# Jira Bulk Delete Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the bulk delete script for removing SCRUM tickets with alert titles.

## Prerequisites

1. **jq**: JSON parser (install with `brew install jq` on macOS)
2. **curl**: HTTP client (usually pre-installed)
3. **Jira API Token**: Personal access token for your Jira account

## Getting Your Jira API Token

1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Give it a label (e.g., "Bulk Delete Script")
4. Copy the generated token (you won't see it again!)

## Configuration

Edit the `bulk-delete-jira-alerts.sh` script and update these variables:

```bash
JIRA_URL="https://your-domain.atlassian.net"        # Your Jira instance URL
JIRA_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"                 # Your Jira email address
JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"                     # Your API token from above
PROJECT_KEY="SCRUM"                                  # Project key (usually SCRUM)
```

## Usage

### 1. Dry Run (Recommended first step)
```bash
./bulk-delete-jira-alerts.sh --dry-run
```
This will show you what tickets would be deleted without actually deleting them.

### 2. Actual Deletion
```bash
./bulk-delete-jira-alerts.sh --delete
```
This will delete the tickets after showing them and asking for confirmation.

### 3. Help
```bash
./bulk-delete-jira-alerts.sh --help
```

## What Gets Deleted

The script finds and deletes SCRUM tickets where the title contains:
- "Workflow Health Alert:" 
- "CRITICAL ALERT:"

Examples of tickets that would be deleted:
- `SCRUM-213: ðŸš¨ Workflow Health Alert: critical (Score: 45/100)`
- `SCRUM-156: CRITICAL ALERT: System Down`
- `SCRUM-987: ðŸ”´ Workflow Health Alert: warning (Score: 62/100)`

## Safety Features

- **Dry run mode**: See what would be deleted before actual deletion
- **Confirmation prompt**: Requires typing "yes" to proceed with deletion
- **Error handling**: Stops on configuration errors or API failures
- **Rate limiting**: 0.5 second delay between deletions to avoid API limits
- **Detailed logging**: Shows success/failure for each deletion

```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors
- Verify your email and API token are correct  
- Make sure your Jira URL is correct (include https://)
- Check that your API token hasn't expired

### Permission Errors
- Ensure you have "Delete Issues" permission in the SCRUM project
- Contact your Jira administrator if you need additional permissions

### No Tickets Found
- The script will exit gracefully if no matching tickets are found
- Verify the search criteria matches your ticket titles

### Rate Limiting
- The script includes a 0.5-second delay between deletions
- If you hit rate limits, the failed deletions will be reported

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your API token** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data in production
- **Test with dry run first** to avoid accidental deletions
- **Keep backups** of important tickets before running bulk operations

## Alternative: Environment Variables

Instead of editing the script, you can set environment variables:

```bash
export JIRA_URL="https://your-domain.atlassian.net"
export JIRA_EMAIL="your-email@example.com" 
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
export PROJECT_KEY="SCRUM"

./bulk-delete-jira-alerts.sh --delete
```
