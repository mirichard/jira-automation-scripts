## Environment Setup

All scripts require these environment variables:
```bash
export JIRA_EMAIL='your-email@domain.com'
export JIRA_API_TOKEN='your-api-token'
```

## Jira Configuration

- **Jira URL:** Configure via environment variable `JIRA_BASE_URL`
- **Project Key:** Configure via environment variable `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`
- **API Version:** v3 (REST API)

## Security Notes

- Never commit API tokens to version control
- Store credentials securely as environment variables
- Use rate limiting to avoid API throttling
- Always test with dry run mode first

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing Framework

Run the comprehensive test suite to validate all automation rules:

```bash
# Set up authentication
source tests/setup-auth.sh

# Run all automation rule tests
./tests/test-automation-rules.sh

# Run tests without cleanup (keep test issues)
./tests/test-automation-rules.sh no-cleanup

# Clean up test issues only
./tests/test-automation-rules.sh cleanup
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

For each automation rule, verify:
- ✅ Trigger fires correctly
- ✅ Conditions are properly evaluated
- ✅ Actions execute as expected
- ✅ Audit logs capture execution
- ✅ Rollback plan is documented and tested

### GitHub Webhook Setup

For GitHub integration rules, configure webhooks:

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to Webhooks → Add webhook
3. Set Payload URL to: `https://YOUR-DOMAIN.atlassian.net/rest/webhooks/1.0/webhook/jira`
4. Content type: `application/json`
5. Select individual events: Pull requests, Issues
6. Ensure webhook is active

### Slack Integration Setup

For Slack notifications, set up environment variables:

```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_TOKEN="your-slack-webhook-token"
export PRODUCT_OWNER_SLACK_ID="@po.username"
export PROJECT_MANAGER_EMAIL="pm@example.com"
export TEAM_LEAD_EMAIL="lead@example.com"
```

## 📊 Validation Results

| Rule Category | Rules Count | Tested | Passed | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|---------|
| General PM & Scrum | 8 | ✅ | ✅ | All basic triggers working - Auto-assignment confirmed (SCRUM-269) |
| Quality & Reporting | 3 | ✅ | ⚠️ | Checklist validation needs custom field |
| Cross-Project | 4 | ✅ | ⚠️ | Requires project permissions |
| GitHub Integration | 5 | ✅ | ✅ | Webhook setup required |
| Slack/Email | 3 | ✅ | ⚠️ | Environment variables needed |

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

### Security Scans
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in YAML files
- ✅ Environment variables used for sensitive data
- ✅ Webhook URLs use secure HTTPS endpoints
- ✅ API tokens follow least-privilege principle

### Compliance Checks
- ✅ GDPR: No personal data stored in automation rules
- ✅ Audit Trail: All automation actions logged in Jira
- ✅ Data Retention: Follows organization policy
- ✅ Access Control: Rules respect Jira permissions

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Basic field updates, comments, labels
- **Medium Risk:** Cross-project cloning, external webhooks
- **High Risk:** Issue deletion, bulk status changes

## 🔄 Rollback Plans

Each automation rule includes:
- **Rollback Plan:** Documented in YAML comments
- **Manual Override:** Ability to reverse automated actions
- **Disable Mechanism:** Easy way to turn off problematic rules
- **Audit Trail:** Full history of automated changes

## 📈 Monitoring & Continuous Improvement

### Performance Metrics
- Automation success rate: Target >95%
- Rule execution time: Monitor for performance
- Error rate: Track and resolve failures
- User satisfaction: Feedback on automation value

### Lessons Learned
- Document common failure scenarios
- Maintain troubleshooting guide
- Regular review of rule effectiveness
- Continuous refinement based on usage

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Failed:** Check JIRA_EMAIL and JIRA_API_TOKEN
2. **Webhook Not Firing:** Verify GitHub webhook configuration
3. **Slack Not Working:** Confirm SLACK_WEBHOOK_TOKEN is valid
4. **Cross-Project Fails:** Check project permissions
5. **Custom Fields Missing:** Verify field names match Jira config

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export JIRA_DEBUG=true
./tests/test-automation-rules.sh
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Set up environment
export JIRA_EMAIL='michael@example.com'
export JIRA_API_TOKEN='your-token-here'

# Clean ticket descriptions
./clean-jira-descriptions.sh

# Update ticket status
./bulk-update-jira-status.sh

# Delete alert tickets (with dry run first)
./bulk-delete-jira-alerts.sh

# Delete ticket range
./bulk-delete-jira-range.sh

# Run automation tests
source tests/setup-auth.sh && ./tests/test-automation-rules.sh
```
